## Implications for Cardano Go PBL Course
All of these phases create the raw materials for some engaging projects in the upcoming Cardano Go PBL Course!

### Compelling Project #1
- Consume dev.andamio.io endpoint and parse results - just as an exercise in Go and for feedback
Suppose we need information from the blockchain. We have several options:
1. Query the entire chain directly, get raw data
2. Consume API endpoints that somehow pre-process that data
3. Set up our own local store of data

Let's work through these examples.
1. This option is always open to us, but it is inefficient -- we'll revisit it later
2. Example with dev.andamio.io
3. CP#2

### Compelling Project #2
- [ ] From working Adder Example, can we create an endpoint that bootstraps an index?
    - Start the indexer at specified parameters
    - Save to local db
    - Query an endpoint
    - That would be a big win!

Then, with these ideas established, let's look at how UTxO RPC helps + where it fits in the dev stack
