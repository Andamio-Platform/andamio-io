Now that you have an **Access Token**, let's talk about how to use it.

In Lesson 101.1, you minted your Andamio Access Token. At the end of the lesson, you took a look at your [Andamio Dashboard]().

Bookmark this page. It is where you will a record of your progress in this Course, and in the future, when you enroll in other Courses on the Andamio Network.

For now, that's all you need to know. But keep your Andamio Dashboard open: in the next lesson, we'll see if we can change that data in your Access Token!
