### Commit to Your First Assignment: Coming to Cardano Preprod, April 2024
Coming soon!

Now you're getting a feel how Andamio supports people to learn by doing.

Now that you have committed to the first Assignment, a **Course Facilitator** will approve it.

The approval process is an important part of how Andamio works. In this course, we'll look at that too.
