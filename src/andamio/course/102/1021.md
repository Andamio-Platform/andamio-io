## How Courses are Built in Andamio
Every Course in Andamio consists of a series of Modules. Every Module consists of one or more Student Learning Targets. Each Student Learning Target (or SLT) indicates what Learners will learn.

You can review the home page of this Course to see a list of all Modules and SLTs.

## About Lessons
Each Student Learning Target has one Lesson that introduces what you need to know about the SLT. In some lessons, like this one, there is simple text that you can read, and a video that you can watch. Other lessons, like 102.3 provide a guided tutorial for how to accomplish something.

## About Assignments
At the end of each Module is an Assignment. In [the next lesson](), we will take a look at how Assignments work.
