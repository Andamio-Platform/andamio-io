Andamio is built to support Learners to become Contributors to impactful projects across a distributed network of organizations.

The first step toward being a Contributor is to be a Learner. In Module 101, you enrolled in Andamio PBL - so now you're officially a Learner. Congratulations! In the next Module, you will learn how to become a Contributor. But first, in this Module, you will learn more about how Assignments work.
