## We are underway!

Cardano Go Live Coding launched on Monday 2024-03-11 with a deep dive into project structure and two project examples.

### How We Got Started

One of the goals of Cardano Go Live Coding is to create spaces for people to try projects so that they can learn new things. A regular meeting is one example of a space - it exists in time, and anyone can join in. Another kind of space is an open-source project repository, where anyone is welcome to contribute. So on Monday, we first convened in the temporal space of the weekly meeting, and I introduced a project structure intended to allow anyone to create an island, and to experiment in the weeks to come.

We started off by taking a close look at how the

### Andamio CLI is a Wrapper for "Islands" of Activity
We are building Andamio CLI with a Go library called [Cobra](https://cobra.dev/). Cobra provides boilerplate functionality that makes it quick and easy to build your own command-line interfaces. It can be installed in any Go project. The developers of Cobra built their own command-line interface (with Cobra, of course) called `cobra-cli` that includes some utilities for working with the Cobra library in your projects. You can [learn more about Cobra on GitHub](https://github.com/spf13/cobra).

With a few extra steps, we can create spaces where productive, collaborative hacking can happen - without having any impact on any other parts of `andamio-cli`. These steps were illustrated on Monday - check out this timestamp...

By structuring the project this way, we can each embark on different explorations, add them to the shared project, and tinker with the results. As a result, we can start to imagine a project structure like this:

### What Islands did we build?
Two simple ones, each of which raises new questions and suggests follow-up tasks
We built an andamio-cli that does two things:

It writes metadata

It queries chain tip

### What’s next:
- Define some potential features, add to public Notion and Miro
- We'll continue to add experimental islands to `andamio-cli`
- Moving forward, we will start doing experiments in these islands
- We are building toward a formal Cardano Go PBL Course - these sessions are how we start to build the raw material of that course, by creating projects that might be included in the course. For example, we can imagine writing a lesson about metadata formatting that includes the `andamio-cli write metadata` example from Monday's session.

### If you’re just getting started

- Cardano Go PBL coming soon
- Look at these links
2. Youtube video from go guy - he calls them palettes. Same idea
