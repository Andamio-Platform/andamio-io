## Cardano Go Live Coding is Underway!

[Cardano Go Live Coding](https://andamio.notion.site/Open-Source-Cardano-Go-Libraries-Docs-Andamio-CLI-5266383e226246edb37d4c859d2a0a31?pvs=4) launched on Monday 2024-03-11 with a deep dive into project structure and two project examples.

### How We Got Started

One of the goals of Cardano Go Live Coding is for people to try projects so that they can learn new things. With [weekly meetings](/calendar) and an [open-source project repository](https://github.com/Andamio-Platform/andamio-cli), we want to make spaces where anyone is welcome to try something new.

We started off with an example of how a command-line interface project can be structured. Then, we looked at two examples of isolated projects that do different things and can be developed independently.

In case you missed it, the video is on YouTube:

### Andamio CLI is a Wrapper for "Islands" of Activity
We are building [Andamio CLI](https://github.com/Andamio-Platform/andamio-cli) with a Go library called [Cobra](https://cobra.dev/). Cobra provides boilerplate functionality that makes it quick and easy to build your own command-line interfaces. It can be installed in any Go project. The developers of Cobra built their own command-line interface (with Cobra, of course) called `cobra-cli` that includes some utilities for working with the Cobra library in your projects. You can [learn more about Cobra on GitHub](https://github.com/spf13/cobra).

With a few extra steps, we can create spaces where productive, collaborative hacking can happen - without having any impact on any other parts of `andamio-cli`. By structuring the project this way, we can each embark on different explorations, add them to the shared project, and tinker with the results.

As a result, we can start to imagine a project structure like this:

### What "Islands" did we build?
For the initial demo, we explored two simple examples, each of which raises new questions and suggests follow-up tasks.

1. `andamio-cli write nft-metadata` provides a series of command-line prompts and writes a `.json` file that corresponds to CIP-25 metadata standards.

2. `andamio-cli query tip` returns the current tip of a running Cardano Node. It's not as helpful as `cardano-cli query tip`, but it's an example of how we can pull in other libraries to interact with Cardano. It was built by taking [the chain-tip example](https://github.com/blinklabs-io/gouroboros-starter-kit/tree/main/cmd/chain-tip) from the [gOurobouros Starter Kit](https://github.com/blinklabs-io/gouroboros-starter-kit), published by [Blink Labs](https://github.com/blinklabs-io).

These are just examples. Now that we have some spaces, we can start to think about what we really want to accomplish.

### Up Next:
- Define some potential features, add to public [Notion Dashboard](https://andamio.notion.site/Open-Source-Cardano-Go-Libraries-Docs-Andamio-CLI-5266383e226246edb37d4c859d2a0a31) and [Cardano Go Live Coding Miro Board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVNiCr_Y4=/?share_link_id=751356830842)
- We'll continue to add experimental islands to `andamio-cli`
- We are building toward a formal Cardano Go PBL Course - these sessions are how we start to build the raw material of that course, by creating projects that might be included in the course. For example, we can imagine writing a lesson about metadata formatting that includes the `andamio-cli write metadata` example from Monday's session.

### Follow the project:

1. Notion page - [public dashboard](https://andamio.notion.site/Open-Source-Cardano-Go-Libraries-Docs-Andamio-CLI-5266383e226246edb37d4c859d2a0a31?pvs=4)
2. [Andamio CLI on GitHub](https://github.com/Andamio-Platform/andamio-cli)

### Register for Weekly Live Coding Sessions
- [Every Monday 1300-1400 UTC](https://us06web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZwtcemrqTwoG9fYL2pYvrCwQG9u2tJNmqa6#/registration)

### If youâ€™re just getting started

- If you are a brand new to Go, check out the [official tutorial](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/getting-started). Then, take a look at [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/) - it's a great introduction.
- [On YouTube: How to write beautiful Golang CLI](https://youtu.be/SSRIn5DAmyw?si=ii62s6nVjiX4cUz6) is a helpful overview of Cobra CLI, and it illustrates the design patterns we're using with Andamio CLI
- Cardano Go PBL is currently in development - we'll share more soon!
