## UTxO RPC
[UTxO RPC](https://utxorpc.org/) is a collaborative project from [TxPipe](https://txpipe.io/) and [Blink Labs](https://blinklabs.io/) that was funded in Project Catalyst Fund 11. You can read the proposals here:
- [gRPC ‚ù§Ô∏è Cardano: A streaming API for Cardano using Dolos by TxPipe](https://projectcatalyst.io/funds/11/cardano-open-developers/grpc-cardano-a-streaming-api-for-cardano-using-dolos-by-txpipe)
- [Cardano Node API: a Cardano Node companion written in Go](https://projectcatalyst.io/funds/11/cardano-use-cases-solution/cardano-node-api-a-cardano-node-companion-written-in-go)

This week at [Cardano Go Live Coding](https://andamio.notion.site/Open-Source-Cardano-Go-Libraries-Docs-Andamio-CLI-5266383e226246edb37d4c859d2a0a31), we took our first look at what these projects will mean for the Cardano developer community. UTxO RPC is about a lot more than Go Development. It provides a common specificiation for how Go, Rust, Python, and JavaScript developers can build applications Cardano. This week's session was a great place for any developer to understand how.

In case you missed it, [here's a link to the video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfJ7ozg6RWU).

### This Week at Cardano Go Live Coding

In our first two sessions, we gave some general structure to how we can work together during these weekly sessions.

This week, our Miro board went from looking like this:

To start the session, I asked two questions:

1. For the needs of Andamio, what might we build into Andamio CLI?
2. For the purposes of learning and experimenting, what can we just play with?

Chris had a [great answer to the second question](https://youtu.be/AfJ7ozg6RWU?si=6EIkNkeaI0nADdMc&t=176): a lot of what we might want to do maps to emerging, exciting work going on with [UTxO RPC](https://utxorpc.org/).

# Three ways to "query tip"
To understand why developers are going to love UTxO RPC, let's look at an example together. Suppose that we want to write a Go function that gets the most recent block on a blockchain. There are a few ways to do it.

### #1: With an API
A simple approach would be to make a request to a Cardano API provider like Blockfrost, and wrap it in some Go boilerplate:

```go

...

func queryTip() {
  url := "https://cardano-preprod.blockfrost.io/api/v0/blocks/latest"

  req, err := http.NewRequest("GET", url, nil)
  if err != nil {
    fmt.Println("Error creating request:", err)
    return
  }

  req.Header.Set("project_id", "your project id")

  client := &http.Client{}
  resp, err := client.Do(req)
  if err != nil {
    fmt.Println("Error on response:", err)
    return
  }
  defer resp.Body.Close()

  body, err := ioutil.ReadAll(resp.Body)
  if err != nil {
    fmt.Println("Error reading body:", err)
    return
  }

  var block Block
  err = json.Unmarshal(body, &block)
  if err != nil {
    fmt.Println("Error decoding JSON:", err)
    return
  }

  fmt.Printf(
    "Chain Tip:\nSlot: %-10d Block Hash: %x\n",
    block.Slot,
    block.Hash,
  )
}
```

This is convenient because all we need is an API endpoint, and just like that, we have the data we need! But as you can see, there's a lot of boilerplate for simply handling the JSON response from the API. What if we didn't have to retrieve and parse JSON to get the same result?

### #2: With gOuroboros, as shown in [Go Live Coding #001](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DktHzCz5eds)
Another way to write a `queryTip` function is to use lower-level tools like [gOuroboros](https://github.com/blinklabs-io/gouroboros), from Blink Labs. In this example, we can see how `gouroboros` establishes a direct connection (in this case with a synced Cardano Node at `cfg.Address`), and gets the current tip of the blockchain.

What's nice about this approach is that we are not translating any data from JSON. The gOuroboros client just provides it in a format that's easy to read. On line 39, we get `tip` from the client. Then on lines 45 and 46 we print directly from that data.

```go
import (
  ...
  ouroboros "github.com/blinklabs-io/gouroboros"
)

...

func chainTip() {
  // Set config defaults
  var cfg = Config{
    Magic:   1,
    Address: "0.0.0.0:3001",
  }
  // Parse environment variables
  if err := envconfig.Process("cardano_node", &cfg); err != nil {
    panic(err)
  }
  // Create error channel
  errorChan := make(chan error)
  // start error handler
  go func() {
    for {
      err := <-errorChan
      panic(err)
    }
  }()
  // Configure Ouroboros
  o, err := ouroboros.NewConnection(
    ouroboros.WithNetworkMagic(uint32(cfg.Magic)),
    ouroboros.WithErrorChan(errorChan),
    ouroboros.WithNodeToNode(true),
  )
  if err != nil {
    panic(err)
  }
  if err = o.Dial("tcp", cfg.Address); err != nil {
    panic(err)
  }
  tip, err := o.ChainSync().Client.GetCurrentTip()
  if err != nil {
    panic(err)
  }
  fmt.Printf(
    "Chain Tip:\nSlot: %-10d Block Hash: %x\n",
    tip.Point.Slot,
    tip.Point.Hash,
  )
  fmt.Println()
}
```

Still, there's a lot of boilerplate, this time for making the connection to our data source. What if we didn't have to include all of that, or pull in all of the `gouroboros` library every time we wanted to use it?

### #3: With UTxO RPC
Here is what the same function might look like with [UTxO RPC](https://github.com/utxorpc/go-sdk/blob/main/examples/sync/main.go). It combines the convenience of using and endpoint like Blockfrost, with the native data types exposed by a native library like gOuroboros:

We simply have to grab the `baseUrl` (that's our data source) and create a client (just like in example #1). Then, we can run functions directly on that client. What's more, these functions will have the same names is Rust, Python, and JavaScript! Check out [these docs](https://utxorpc.org/sync/spec#chainsyncservice): the specifications for each Module are the same for any supported language. This means that across programming languages, developers will be able to use the same logic to build applications.

```go
package main

import (
	...

	"connectrpc.com/connect"
	sync "github.com/utxorpc/go-codegen/utxorpc/v1alpha/sync"
	utxorpc "github.com/utxorpc/go-sdk"
)

func queryTipExampleGoSDK() {
  ctx := context.Background()
  httpClient := &http.Client{
    // set up your http client
  }
  baseUrl := "https://preview.utxorpc-v0.demeter.run"
  client := utxorpc.NewClient(httpClient, baseUrl)
  req := connect.NewRequest(&sync.FetchBlockRequest{})
  // set API key for demeter
  req.Header().Set("dmtr-api-key", "dmtr_utxorpc1...")
  fmt.Println("connecting to utxorpc host:", baseUrl)
  chainSync, err := client.ChainSync.FetchBlock(ctx, req)
  if err != nil {
    fmt.Println(connect.CodeOf(err))
    if connectErr := new(connect.Error); errors.As(err, &connectErr) {
      fmt.Println(connectErr.Message())
      fmt.Println(connectErr.Details())
    }
    panic(err)
    os.Exit(1)
  }
  fmt.Println("connected to utxorpc...")
  for i, blockRef := range chainSync.Msg.Block {
    fmt.Printf("Block[%d]:\n", i)
    fmt.Printf("Index: %d\n", blockRef.GetCardano().GetHeader().GetSlot())
    fmt.Printf("Hash: %x\n", blockRef.GetCardano().GetHeader().GetHash())
  }
}
```

### The Data's got to come from somewhere...

In the example above, the `baseUrl` is `https://preview.utxorpc-v0.demeter.run`. This is what [TxPipe]() is building to deliver on the [gRPC ‚ù§Ô∏è Cardano: A streaming API for Cardano using Dolos by TxPipe](https://projectcatalyst.io/funds/11/cardano-open-developers/grpc-cardano-a-streaming-api-for-cardano-using-dolos-by-txpipe) project. [Dolos](https://txpipe.github.io/dolos/) is "a new type of Cardano node, fine-tuned to solve a very narrow scope: keeping an updated copy of the ledger and replying to queries from trusted clients, while requiring a small fraction of the resources". It creates a way to serve the data we need for UTxO RPC to work.

We'd all like to make sure that this layer is robust! To deliver on the Fund 11 proposal linked above, Blink Labs is building [cardano-node-api](https://github.com/blinklabs-io/cardano-node-api) as another way to provide the data for UTxO RPC.

At Gimbalabs, we are excited to make sure that these services are accessible. The variety of data providers coming online right now, and the variety of ways that these services can be deployed and shared gives us confidence that the Cardano application ecosystem will be build on robust, reliable, and distributed foundations.

### What's Next?
- At Cardano Go Live Coding, we'll continue to dive into the details of how `cardano-node-api` and UTxO RPC work. We'll also look at examples of how application developers can use them.
- Just like we can write a `queryTip` function in a few different ways, we can apply similar patterns to transaction building. In the next live coding sessions, we will start to look at some examples.
