## What we wanted to do:
The meeting discussed building utilities on Cardano in Golang, specifically focusing on deploying reference scripts on the blockchain. The team explored the concept of reference scripts, which allow attaching compiled Plutus scripts to UTXOs for later reference by transactions. They aimed to create a command-line interface (CLI) utility to deploy reference scripts, making it easier for developers to build Cardano applications. The discussion involved understanding the Apollo library's functionality for handling reference scripts and transaction building. The team faced challenges in implementing the desired functionality during the meeting but planned to continue exploring solutions with the help of the Apollo library maintainer.

The meeting began with an introduction to the context and goals of the project. The team is working on building utilities on Cardano using Golang as part of a Catalyst proposal. The concept of 'building in public' was highlighted, with the aim of creating tools that could benefit the broader Cardano developer community. Previous work involved building basic CLI utilities for querying the blockchain and handling simple transactions.

## What we did:
00:00:44Deploying Reference Scripts
The main focus of the meeting was on deploying reference scripts, a feature introduced in the Plutus V2 update. Reference scripts allow attaching compiled Plutus scripts to UTXOs, making them accessible for later use in transactions without the need for spending the UTXO. This approach can reduce transaction costs and enable decentralized applications. The team discussed the need for a CLI utility to deploy reference scripts, which is a common task when building Cardano applications.
00:01:03Exploring the Apollo Library
The team explored the Apollo library, a Golang library for building Cardano transactions. They discussed the library's functionality for handling reference scripts and transaction building. The discussion involved understanding the library's API and data structures, as well as identifying the appropriate functions and methods to achieve the desired functionality.
00:01:15Implementation Challenges
During the meeting, the team faced challenges in implementing the desired functionality for deploying reference scripts using the Apollo library. They encountered difficulties in attaching the compiled Plutus script to the transaction output and properly handling the reference script data. The team explored various approaches, such as modifying data structures and using different library functions, but were unable to find a straightforward solution during the meeting.
## What we learned:
00:01:37Future Plans and Collaboration
The team acknowledged the ambitious nature of the task and decided to continue exploring solutions with the help of the Apollo library maintainer, Eduardo. They discussed reaching out to Eduardo for guidance and potentially contributing improvements to the library if necessary. Additionally, the team expressed openness to exploring alternative approaches or focusing on different aspects of transaction building in future meetings.

## What's Next?
00:02:19Contact Eduardo, the maintainer of the Apollo library, to discuss the challenges faced and seek guidance on implementing the desired functionality for deploying reference scripts.
00:02:37Continue exploring the Apollo library's codebase and documentation to identify potential solutions or alternative approaches.
00:02:53Prepare to discuss and work on other aspects of transaction building, such as handling datums and datum parts, in future meetings.
00:03:11Be open to suggestions from the community and consider building other utilities or features based on their requests and needs.

### If youâ€™re just getting started

- If you are a brand new to Go, check out the [official tutorial](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/getting-started). Then, take a look at [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/) - it's a great introduction.
- [On YouTube: How to write beautiful Golang CLI](https://youtu.be/SSRIn5DAmyw?si=ii62s6nVjiX4cUz6) is a helpful overview of Cobra CLI, and it illustrates the design patterns we're using with Andamio CLI
- Cardano Go PBL is currently in development - we'll share more soon!
