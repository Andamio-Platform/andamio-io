[![dandelion intersect prototype](/blog/013a.png)](https://dandelion-intersect-prototype.andamio.io/)

Right now, we are preparing the [Andamio Course Platform](https://andamio.io) to go live. At the same time, we are always looking ahead to the full picture of Andamio.

When it is released in Q4 2024, the full-scale Andamio Platform is set to provide a cohesive experience of learning and contribution management so that people can access knowledge and opportunities for impactful collaboration.

In this blog post, we introduce the Andamio Contributor Prototype, which is currently deployed on Cardano Mainnet for live testing in three instances:
1. [Gimbalabs](): funded by Project Catalyst [proposal]()
2. [Dandelion Intersect Grant](): funded by Intersect
3. [Andamio + Cardano Go Development](): funded by Project Catalyst [proposal]()

### What it does
Each Contribution Prototype holds tokens. For now, these tokens include Ada and Gimbals, but that can change. Each prototype also includes a list of Projects.

Contributors can commit to completing projects and earn tokens. Reviewers approve completed work and releaase the tokens to Contributors. Administrators decide which projects are listed, and they define the rewards connected with each.

We are still working on names for these roles - if you have ideas, please [be in touch](https://andmaio.io/contact)

### Wait, You're Testing on Mainnet?
We certainly are - but not in the way you might think! The Andamio Contributor Prototype is a project that has been in development for nearly three years. It made its public debut in the second iteration of [Plutus Project-Based Learning](https://plutuspbl.io), in early 2022.

Since then, we've developed and refined the contracts, built reliable transactions, and rigorously tested the application on testnet. From a technical perspective, the app is ready for prime time.

But that's only part of the story.

The contribution platform raises new questions about how people work together. No matter how much we might test the application from a technical perspective, a different sort of testing happens once people are using an application.

### Governance Questions and Roles

The most exciting questions raised by Andamio are about governance. To understand these questions, we must talk about roles. Who gets to play each one?

- Who is a contributor?
- Who is a reviewer?
- Who is an adminstrator?

These questions have more to do with people, collaboration, politics and transparency. Even though the technology works, we have to figure out how people actually use it together.

### Implications for Catalyst, Intersect, and beyond
How are funds used? Who contributes? Who decides?

### Implications for identity
Questions to drive r+d

### Implications for Andmaio Platform
What happens when we're integrated?
