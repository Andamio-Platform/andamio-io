Even as the Andamio Course Platform prepares to go live, we are always looking ahead to the full picture of Andamio.

When it is released in Q4 2024, the full-scale Andamio Platform is set to provide a cohesive experience of learning and contribution management so that people can access knowledge and opportunities for impactful collaboration.

In this blog post, we introduce the Andamio Contributor Prototype, which is currently deployed on Cardano Mainnet for live testing in three instances:
1. Gimbalabs (using funds from)
2. Dandelion Intersect Grant (using funds from)
3. Cardano Go Development (using funds from)

### Wait, You're Testing on Mainnet?
We certainly are - but not in the way you might think! The Andamio Contributor Prototype is a project that has been in development for nearly three years. It made its public debut in the second iteration of Plutus Project-Based learning, back in early 2022.

Since then, we've developed and refined the contracts, built reliable transactions, and rigorously tested the application on testnet. From a technical perspective, the app is ready for prime time.

But that's only part of the story.

The contribution platform raises new questions about how people work together

- Who is a contributor?
- Who is a reviewer?
- Who is an adminstrator?

These questions have more to do with people, collaboration, politics and transparency. Even though the technology works, we have to figure out how people actually use it together.

### Implications for Catalyst, Intersect, and beyond
How are funds used? Who contributes? Who decides?

### Implications for identity
Questions to drive r+d

### Implications for Andmaio Platform
What happens when we're integrated?
