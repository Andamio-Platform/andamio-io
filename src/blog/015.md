[FC Barcelona](https://www.fcbarcelona.com/) - a member-owned sports franchise, with a global fan base and massive social media following - presented a [Catalyst proposal in Fund 12](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/125751).

How did this happen? What was the process to onboard them?

It all can be summarized in two words:

# Building Trust

My name is Yoram, and I'm one of Andamio's co-founders. I have been involved with blockchain and impact businesses for over 10 years and have been an advisor to [Plastiks.io](https://www.plastiks.io/) for the last 12 months (we are also onboarding them to Cardano). We have built a strong relationship and recognize our shared values.

Here is the story of how FC Barcelona came to Cardano.

### Catalyst Fund 12 Launch Event

[Barca Vision (a subsidiary of FC Barcelona)](https://barcavision.fcbarcelona.com/) has been a partner of Plastiks for the last two years and has built strong human collaboration between the teams. It takes a lot of time, and it’s a big step for a leading brand to collaborate with startups. This collaboration is normally built on confidence between the teams.

The [Catalyst Fund 12 event launch in Barcelona](https://lu.ma/m5lq3loo) was a great place to bring it all together. The Plastiks team joined the event, and when [Kriss Baird](https://twitter.com/krissbaird) announced the new [Cardano Partners and Real World Integrations Category](https://projectcatalyst.io/funds/12/cardano-partners-and-real-world-integrations) for Fund 12, it was a good trigger to invite the Barca Vision team. As they are based in Barcelona (sometimes the stars also need to be aligned), they joined us for the event. It is good evidence of the trust established with Plastiks. They met Cardano community members and got a taste of the spirit of the community. [Cardano Foundation](https://cardanofoundation.org/), [Emurgo](https://www.emurgo.io/), and [IOG](https://iohk.io/) teams were also very supportive at the event and throughout the onboarding process.

### The Idea

Next, the Barca Vision team sent us a brief about a key project they are working on:

***“How can Barça Vision positively impact women and foster economic sustainability using Discord as the hub for its Web3 social media community? The transition from social engagement to a Web3 empowered community and grow interactions with international markets”***

This was a perfect pitch for [Andamio](https://andamio.io) and the introduction of our blockchain-enabled *Trust Layer*. Andamio is building trust through actions. We use blockchain technology to create credentials that represent an individual’s skills and contributions. It provides a Web 3 platform to teach new skills, connect to contribution opportunities, and build reputation while also generating rewards for users. This is a great match with the Barca Vision brief.

### Building with Our Partners

The next step was to leverage our connections and bring onboard some strong partners. Plastiks was the obvious choice for the sustainability challenge and part of their onboarding to Cardano - check out also [their proposal for building a plastic credit marketplace on Cardano](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/119232). Cardano Foundation (which provided ongoing support) introduced [Women in Tech Global](https://women-in-tech.org/), which brings unrivaled experience as a women's and tech empowerment partner. [NMKR](https://www.nmkr.io/) is a key partner in providing knowledge and infrastructure for NFT-based rewards mechanisms.

### Delivering the Proposal

Multiple in-person and online meetings later, the proposal was published on the Catalyst platform. We've already established regular weekly meetings to discuss the project and alignments between the teams. Step by step, as trust is being built, we are discussing more and more opportunities for collaboration and hope we are at the beginning of multiple projects with Barca Vision and the Cardano ecosystem.


### Read the Proposal

A human trust layer and technology-based trust infrastructure came together to onboard a leading brand to Cardano. We are excited to have a brief based on the values of empowerment and collaboration in the global ecosystem of FC Barcelona fans. We expect that by providing Andamio infrastructure for this project, we will unlock new ideas across a global community, as people collaborate on impactful projects and build long-lasting relationships.


Here is our joint proposal: [https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/125751](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/125751)
